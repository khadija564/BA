# Business Process Modeling

Business Process Modeling is a critical and essential skill required by a Technical Business Analyst. It allows to visually represent and analyse the business processes, its key inefficiencies, and design improvements to improve the overall business processes.

### Purpose of Business Process Modeling 
1. To enhance business process understanding
2. To identify the inefficiencies that can hinder business operations
3. To facilitate business process improvement
4. To align processes with organisational objectives 


### How Business Process Modeling supports a functional/technical business analyst
1. Problem Identification : 
   It assits business analysts to identify business problems and existing inefficiencies allowing them to identify the process improvement strategies.  
2. Requirements Gathering :
    Based on the current state of business processes, future state can be visualised and requirements can eb gathered.  
3. Clear Communication : 
    Allows business analysts to communicate clearly with the associated stakeholders, developers, and management 
4. Process Automation : 
    It forms the basis for business processes automation or workflow engines


**Note:**    There is always a confusion about **Process Modeling** and **Process Mapping** 
 - Both of them are two different methods to improve business processes
 - **Process Mapping** involves documentation and creation of graphical representation of business processes.     
 - **Process Modeling** also provides graphical representation of busines processes but focusses on more detailed analysis and optimisation of business processes.


It typically involves the following:
1. Analysis - It involves identification of current business processes and locating the pain points the mitigate them. 
2. Modeling - It involves creation of visuals such as flow charts, dkiagrams for better understanding and showcasing to stakeholders 
3. Design - It involves improving the business processes by identifying the opportunities for improvement in efficiency, and automation  
4. Implementation - It involves the actions involved to improve the overall processes in practical.

Business process models involves following widely used techniques:
-   Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
-   Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC) Modeling  

**BPMN** : It is a widely used process modeling technique for business processes representation using grahical models

Elements of BPMN includes:
- Activities : Rectangular shaped representing tasks or sub-processes
- Gateways : Diamond shaped representing decision points 
- Events : Denoted by circles representing staart, intermediate, and end points in the modeling 
- Connectors : They are denoted by arrows representing sequence flow

**EPC** : It focusses on event-driven processes involving graphical representation of processes with an emphasis on events and their relationships (*Let me know if you'd like to know more about this modeling type in the comment section and I'd be more than happy to Post on this* :)     )

<!-- Elements of EPC includes:
- Events
- Process Flows
- Decision Points
- Data Management Functions -->

## Best Practices for BPM
- Simple start : Use high level diagrams and add iterative details  
- Stakeholder engagement : Involve stakeholders in the process
- Focus on Goals - Align processes with business goals
- Standardize notation : Use BPMN or other standard formats for keeping consistency accross modeling
- Validate and iterate : Review models with associated stakeholders and iteratively refine them
- Document Assumptions : Analyse any  assumptions made during modeling

## Seven Steps for successful Implementation of Business Process Modeling  

To **leverage the benefits of Business Process Modeling**, here are key steps that can be followed:

1.   **Defining objectives** of your organisation to achieve operational efficiency and reaching targetted goals
2.   **Selection of effective technique** that aligns with business goals and ensure efficient modeling
3.   **Training team** to upskill them in the process modeling 
4.   **Executing Pilot Project**  to assess the modeling impact and efficiency before actual implementation
5.   **Collecting feedback** from stakeholders and repective team members to refine the approach taken
6.   **Rolling out** across organisation to ensure lessons from Pilot project are effectively applied
7.   **Regular review and updates** to identify potential areas that require improvement for changing business needs.
